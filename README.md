This repository accompanies the session Introduction to Probability, which assumes and aims to exploit prior knowledge of programming, 
so as to effectively learn fundamental probability concepts through connection to programming concepts and extensive use of data simulation.

To follow the session, no prior knowledge of probability theory or statistics is required.
