[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/uio-bmi/stats_for_cs/blob/main/Week_2_ProbabilityIntro/Session1_ProbabilityIntro.ipynb)

This repository accompanies the Statistics for Programmers course. It assumes and aims to exploit prior knowledge of programming, 
so as to effectively learn fundamental probability and statistics concepts through connection to programming and extensive use of data simulation.

To follow these sessions, no prior knowledge of probability theory or statistics is required.
